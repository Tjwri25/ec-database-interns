What is the database project? What does it need to do?

Port data from several desktop computer hard drives (seed data based on data gathered through various application/registration forms) to new database. See forms Elevating Connections is using on database-assets channel.

Sort and search for data:
* campers
* sibling information of campers
* placement/foster home contacts 
* day volunteers 
* overnight volunteers for camp 
* background-check status of volunteers 
* corporate sponsors 
* service providers 
* board members 
* staff members 
* writing workshop participants 
* poetry jam participants 
* various retreat participants 
* fundraising event attendees 
* donors of any kind (random checks) 
* community contacts 
* grant sources
* facility contacts
* corporate partners (Boredom Fighters, CCD, Comedy Night)
* in-kind donations
* resource/gift recipients
* sources of referrals to EC (responses to “how did you find us?“)

Input new data through a general sign-up form linked from the main EC website (squarespace)!

Input new data directly into the database website as needed

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model for the database needs to include all the fields we can glean from many sources of data, including all of these registration forms that Elevating Connections uses to gather information about participants/service providers/volunteers/donors/community partners/etc

*If you are in charge of the database/models start with reading through all of the information contained in the forms below to create the initial database models. You will also be the point person to communicate directly with the Executive Director of the nonprofit for clarifications, further information regarding data and seed data through the duration of the project.
